Today I started with the design of the front-end on figma just to see what the site would look like.
Im trying to figure out what the best look to go with is. Since this is a project that I have to do 
quickly, then I'll implement something similar to the 412 set up.

Questions: 

- Should I have a page in the beginning where the user can input what category they are looking for, or 
  is the side bar enough.

- How can I change the layout that I come up with straight into html. Do I user angular materials... 
  something else..?

- What id angular materials exactly?

- Are there anyway of simplifying CSS?
